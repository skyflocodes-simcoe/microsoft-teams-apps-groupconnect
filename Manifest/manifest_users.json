Every group has a Teams channel associated with it where members can chat and post resources and events. The app's bot facilitates matching group members, setting up introductory meetings, and answering employee questions by querying your org's knowledge base. In the event an employee doesn't find a group that meets their interests, they can request to have a new one created."
